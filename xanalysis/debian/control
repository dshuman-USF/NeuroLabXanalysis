Description: spike train analysis tool
 xanalysis does a comprehensive analysis of the full set of spike
 trains from .bdt or .edt files, including cross-correlation,
 autocorrelation, and cycle-triggered histograms, and allows the user
 to label the cross-correlations according to their feature types and
 also to label the respiratory firing patterns of individual spike
 trains.  The results can be written to files that can then be
 imported to a database (like Gaia).
